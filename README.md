# OSDev - OS Development from Scratch.
A simple OS created from scratch in C (with small chunks of Assembly).

The design and the code are heavily inspired by -
1. https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial (An amazing starting point!)
2. https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf (Perfect theory for beginners!)
3. http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html (Well-explained advanced OS design concepts and implementation!)

The OS has been run on Qemu x86 32-bits emulator.
Instead of using GRUB, I have created a customer bootloader following cfenollosa's tutorial (1).

Future Goals - 
1. File System?
2. User Space?
